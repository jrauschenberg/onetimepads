# Encode or Decode One-Time Pad Messages!

Given a message the user wants to encode or decode, and a pre-existing key the user has, this web application will produce an encoded or decoded message.

## Installation

1. Download the git repository to your local computer.

2. Install dependencies using the Terminal app

  ```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Run the application by typing
  ```bash
npm start
```
and
  ```bash
gulp build
```
Hereafter, you can make sure gulp is running by simply typing
  ```bash
gulp
```

2. You should now be able to see the app by typing http://localhost:3000/ into your web browser. Type in your message and key, hit "Encode" or "Decode," and enjoy!
